# Complaint Management System - Frontend

This is a minimal React + Vite + Tailwind frontend for the user role only. It integrates with the backend in this repository.

Quick start:

1. From the `frontend` folder install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Backend must be running at `http://localhost:8080` (default in the provided backend `app.js`).
- Tailwind is already configured. If you update classes, the dev server picks them up.
